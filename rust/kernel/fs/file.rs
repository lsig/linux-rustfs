/// This represents an open file rather than a file on a filesystem. Processes generally reference
/// open files using file descriptors. However, file descriptors are not the same as files. A file
/// descriptor is just an integer that corresponds to a file, and a single file may be referenced
/// by multiple file descriptors.
///
/// # Refcounting
///
/// Instances of this type are reference-counted. The reference count is incremented by the
/// `fget`/`get_file` functions and decremented by `fput`. The Rust type `ARef<File>` represents a
/// pointer that owns a reference count on the file.
///
/// Whenever a process opens a file descriptor (fd), it stores a pointer to the file in its fd
/// table (`struct files_struct`). This pointer owns a reference count to the file, ensuring the
/// file isn't prematurely deleted while the file descriptor is open. In Rust terminology, the
/// pointers in `struct files_struct` are `ARef<File>` pointers.
///
/// ## Light refcounts
///
/// Whenever a process has an fd to a file, it may use something called a "light refcount" as a
/// performance optimization. Light refcounts are acquired by calling `fdget` and released with
/// `fdput`. The idea behind light refcounts is that if the fd is not closed between the calls to
/// `fdget` and `fdput`, then the refcount cannot hit zero during that time, as the `struct
/// files_struct` holds a reference until the fd is closed. This means that it's safe to access the
/// file even if `fdget` does not increment the refcount.
///
/// The requirement that the fd is not closed during a light refcount applies globally across all
/// threads - not just on the thread using the light refcount. For this reason, light refcounts are
/// only used when the `struct files_struct` is not shared with other threads, since this ensures
/// that other unrelated threads cannot suddenly start using the fd and close it. Therefore,
/// calling `fdget` on a shared `struct files_struct` creates a normal refcount instead of a light
/// refcount.
///
/// Light reference counts must be released with `fdput` before the system call returns to
/// userspace. This means that if you wait until the current system call returns to userspace, then
/// all light refcounts that existed at the time have gone away.
///
/// ### The file position
///
/// Each `struct file` has a position integer, which is protected by the `f_pos_lock` mutex.
/// However, if the `struct file` is not shared, then the kernel may avoid taking the lock as a
/// performance optimization.
///
/// The condition for avoiding the `f_pos_lock` mutex is different from the condition for using
/// `fdget`. With `fdget`, you may avoid incrementing the refcount as long as the current fd table
/// is not shared; it is okay if there are other fd tables that also reference the same `struct
/// file`. However, `fdget_pos` can only avoid taking the `f_pos_lock` if the entire `struct file`
/// is not shared, as different processes with an fd to the same `struct file` share the same
/// position.
///
/// To represent files that are not thread safe due to this optimization, the [`LocalFile`] type is
/// used.
///
/// ## Rust references
///
/// The reference type `&File` is similar to light refcounts:
///
/// * `&File` references don't own a reference count. They can only exist as long as the reference
///   count stays positive, and can only be created when there is some mechanism in place to ensure
///   this.
///
/// * The Rust borrow-checker normally ensures this by enforcing that the `ARef<File>` from which
///   a `&File` is created outlives the `&File`.
///
/// * Using the unsafe [`File::from_raw_file`] means that it is up to the caller to ensure that the
///   `&File` only exists while the reference count is positive.
///
/// * You can think of `fdget` as using an fd to look up an `ARef<File>` in the `struct
///   files_struct` and create an `&File` from it. The "fd cannot be closed" rule is like the Rust
///   rule "the `ARef<File>` must outlive the `&File`".
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// * All instances of this type are refcounted using the `f_count` field.
/// * There must not be any active calls to `fdget_pos` on this file that did not take the
///   `f_pos_lock` mutex.
